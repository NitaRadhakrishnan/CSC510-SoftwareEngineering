# Deployment 
The goal of this milestone is to demonstrate a fully deployed version of our Library Bot- L.I.B.R.A.
This slack bot is present in the slack team https://rajshreegroup.slack.com/. The **Librarybot** channel can be used for testing. 
We have deployed the bot in the AWS environment using Ansible.

## Deployment Scripts 
We have used the open source configuration management tool, Ansible, to provide and configure a remote environment for our Library Bot. 

The deployment scripts in Ansible are located in the folder [Deployment](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/tree/master/Deployment) in the repository. 
The deployment folder contains two Ansible playbooks
1. [setup.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/setup.yaml)
   - This playbook contains the setup and necessary installations for python, pip, git, nodejs, forever, npm, and other python packages required to run the code. 
   - It also clones the git repository and runs the forever bot.
2. [requirement.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/requirements.yaml).<br/>
   - This playbook contains the python packages required to run the code.

2. Click on Librarybot channel

### UseCase1: Model Suggestion

**TestCase1:**
1. Test User selects a dataset [Wine.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DAMCOHTMpKuizsAS_SXApEmMgOhXJQ7x) to upload using the attachments button in the Librarybot channel.
2. Test User enters "I want to know the best model for this dataset." in the message field.
3. Test User clicks upload button.
4. Bot responds with a message "Please provide the target column"
5. Test User enters the target column "Class"

**Expected:**

Bot should give one or more model suggestions with a text file describing the process to arrive at best model for the given dataset.

**TestCase2:**
1. Test User selects a dataset [Crime.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XuUWbALxOR2t9NE4ErrF_olQuWJhgbJM) to upload using the attachments button in the Librarybot channel.
2. Test User enters "I want to know the best model for this dataset." in the message field.
3. Test User clicks upload button.
4. Bot responds with a message "Please provide the target column"
5. Test User enters the target column "Category"

**Expected:**

Bot should give one or more model suggestions with a text file describing the process to arrive at best model for the given dataset. Bot should also identify this as categorical dataset and perform n-gram feature classication for each column and then train the dataset.
