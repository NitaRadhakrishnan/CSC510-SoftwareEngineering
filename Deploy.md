# Deployment 
The goal of this milestone is to demonstrate a fully deployed version of our Library Bot- L.I.B.R.A.
This slack bot is present in the slack team https://rajshreegroup.slack.com/. The **Librarybot** channel can be used for testing. 
We have deployed the bot in the AWS environment using Ansible.

### Requirements 
1. A linux/UNIX/MAC machine.  
2. Python and Ansible should be confugured in the system. 

## Deployment Scripts 
We have used the open source configuration management tool, Ansible, to provide and configure a remote environment for our Library Bot. 

The deployment scripts in Ansible are located in the folder [Deployment](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/tree/master/Deployment) in the repository. 
The deployment folder contains two Ansible playbooks
1. [setup.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/setup.yaml)
   - This playbook contains the setup and necessary installations for python, pip, git, nodejs, forever, npm, and other python packages required to run the code. 
   - It also clones the git repository and runs the forever bot.
2. [requirement.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/requirements.yaml).<br/>
   - This playbook contains the python packages required to run the code.
### Steps to deploy 
- In the inventory file we will have to give the public IP address of the AWS instance along with the other parameters and save the inventory file <br/>
Command: vim etc/ansible/hosts

2. Test User enters "I want to know the best model for this dataset." in the message field.
3. Test User clicks upload button.
4. Bot responds with a message "Please provide the target column"
5. Test User enters the target column "Class"

**Expected:**
