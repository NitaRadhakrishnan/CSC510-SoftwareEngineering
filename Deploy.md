# Deployment Scripts 
Deployment scripts are located in the folder Deployment in the repository. The deployment folder contains two playbooks - [setup.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/setup.yaml) and  a vars_file - [requirement.yaml](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/Deployment/requirements.yaml).<br/>

The playbook for setup contains tasks to download and install python, pip, git, nodejs, forever, npm, python packages required to run our code, git clone, run the bot forever. The playbook for requirement contains all the python packages required to run the code. 


# Acceptance Tests 

TA User Account Credentials:

Pre-requisite Steps:
1. Login to https://rajshreegroup.slack.com/ with valid crendentials
2. Click on Librarybot channel

UseCase1: Model Suggestion

TestCase1:
1. Test User selects a dataset(Wine.csv) to upload using the attachments button in the Librarybot channel.
2. Test User enters "I want to know the best model for this dataset." in the message field.
3. Test User clicks upload button.
4. Bot responds with a message "Please provide the target column"
5. Test User enters the target column "Class"

Expected:

Bot should give one or more model suggestions with a text file describing the process to arrive at best model for the given dataset.

TestCase2:
1. Test User selects a dataset(Crime.csv) to upload using the attachments button in the Librarybot channel.
