# Initial Draft 

## Objective 
To develop a bot system that assists visitors with their requests and queries pertaining to the library. 
## Problem Statement  
APIs are flourishing in the developer world, and the web is becoming a mashup of interconnected APIs, the popular ones being that of Java and Python. But the usage of these REST APIs are still unclear to many, which makes it complex for users who are not experts, to use. 

The information available online regarding the usage of such APIs and libraries is vast and diverse. It is tedious to scout around a multitude of these sources and nail down on a satisfying answer and proceed with the implementation. Therefore, it will certainly be beneficial to have a solution that will answer questions posed by users of these APIs in a concise and satisfying manner, all under the same roof.  

## Bot Description

The situation presented in the previous section can be eased by introducing our bot system L.I.B.R.A. (Library-Intensive Bot for Recommendation Assistance) which helps the users in understanding the APIs of Java and Python in a concise and systematic manner, the same way a human expert would help. In other words, it chats with the user to understand what the request of the user is, and then responds to it by yielding information about the keywords related to the APIs and corresponding libraries, and also answer the questions in a human-like manner. This way the users get the solution to their questions all under one roof.
 
The bot is developed to handle four cases. First, when the user wishes to search for an answer to a question, the bot responds by giving information about the libraries and API related keywords in the question, as well as respond to the question in a human-like manner. The second case is when the user wishes to only post a question when there exists no similar question and thereby no definite answer. The third case is when the user wishes to post an answer to an existing question and when the user wishes to post an answer to a question posted by the user itself. This makes it a Documentation Bot as it is equipped to answer users' questions in a human-like manner. This bot follows the "reactor" design pattern which chats with the users when they ask their questions as well as responds to cases, but has no memory of who the user is.
