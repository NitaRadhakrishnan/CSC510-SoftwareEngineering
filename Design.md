# Design

## Objective 
To develop a bot system that assists software engineers/developers with their requests or queries pertaining to Machine Learning  libraries/APIs in Python.

## Problem Statement  
Machine Learning APIs are flourishing in the developer world, and the web is becoming a mashup of interconnected APIs, the popular ones in Python being Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, MxNet. But the usage of these APIs are still unclear to many, which makes it complex for users who are not experts, to use. 

The information available online regarding the usage of such APIs and libraries is vast and diverse. It is tedious to scout around a multitude of these sources and nail down on a satisfying answer and proceed with the implementation. Therefore, it will certainly be beneficial to have a solution that will answer questions regarding these libraries and the implementation on datasets, posed by users of these APIs, in a concise and satisfying manner, all under the same roof, especially when the users are unclear about what has to be done with a dataset.  

## Bot Description

The situation presented in the previous section can be eased by introducing our bot system L.I.B.R.A. (Library-Intensive Bot for Resource Assistance) which helps the users in understanding the ML APIs of Python in a concise and systematic manner, by responding to the user’s requests. The bot is also primarily developed to aid the users in understanding what model has to be applied on the users' dataset, by applying a series of elegant machine learning techniques internally on the dataset. This way the users get the solution to their questions all under one roof.
 
**The bot is developed to handle the following operations** 

- The user wishes to understand what model to apply on a dataset. The bot interacts with the user to understand what the dataset is and where it is to be deployed. It then performs the standard machine learning techniques in python, on the dataset and arrives at the best suited model for the users' dataset and suggests it to the user. This reduces the user's effort in trying to understand from a myriad of sources on what has to be done with the dataset. This feature is applicable when the users' data set is either a numerical one or a combination of numeric and alphanumeric content. 

- The user requests for information about an ML library or API in python, then bot renders this information. 

This bot is developed to respond to the user’s requests which act as events, which makes this a response bot. The bot follows the "reactor" design pattern which chats with the users when they ask their questions as well as respond to cases, but has no memory of who the user is.


## Use Cases 
#### Use Case 1: Model Suggestion for a numeric dataset <!-- Bot suggests the model to be used, in answer to a user's request about not having a clarity about what to do with the dataset --> <!-- User must have a data set to know about the library to be used -->
```
1 Preconditions: User must have LIBRA Access Token in the System. User must know the type of dataset for which he wants suggestion.
2 Main Flow: 
  User requests library/API suggestion for a numeric dataset. Bot runs the Machine Learning techiniques(preprocessing, model building, model selection, etc.) in python on the dataset in the background and arrives at the best suitable model to be used for the dataset.
3 Sub Flow 1:
  [s1] User requests for model suggestion for a dataset.
  [s2] Bot asks whether it is numerical dataset or a assorted (numeric+alphanumeric) dataset.
  [s3] User responds by selecting numeric dataset.
  [s4] Bot sends the dataset to the backend where a series of Machine Learning techiniques in Python are applied to the dataset to find the best model for the dataset
  [s5] The result from the procedure in [s4] is then passed back to the user
4 Alternate FLow:
  [E1] User's dataset is neither numerical nor a combination of numeric and alphanumeric. The bot responds with a relevant message indicating an invalid selection.
```
#### Use Case 2: Model Suggestion for alphanumeric+numeric dataset<!-- Bot suggests the model to be used, in answer to a user's request about not having a clarity about what to do with the dataset --> <!-- User must have a data set to know about the library to be used -->
```
1 Preconditions: User must have LIBRA Access Token in the System. User must know the type of dataset for which he wants suggestion.
2 Main Flow: 
  User requests model suggestion for an assorted (numeric+alphanumeric) dataset. Bot runs the Machine Learning techiniques (Preprocessing, model building, model selection, etc.) in python on the dataset in the background and arrives at the best suitable model to be used for the dataset.
3 Sub Flow 1:
  [s1] User requests for model suggestion for a dataset.
  [s2] Bot asks whether it is numerical dataset or a assorted (numeric+alphanumeric) dataset.
  [s3] User responds by selecting assorted dataset.
  [s4] Bot sends the dataset to the backend where a series of Machine Learning techiniques in Python are applied to find the best model for the dataset by appropriately handling the categorical and continuous values in the dataset.
  [s5] The result from the procedure in [s4] is then passed back to the user
4 Alternate FLow:
  [E1] User's dataset is neither numerical nor a combination of numeric and alphanumeric. The bot responds with a relevant message indicating an invalid selection.
```

#### Use Case 3: Know about a Library/API <!--Bot renders description for library/API that is requested by the user-->
```
1 Preconditions: User must have LIBRA Access Token in the System.
2 Main Flow: 
  User requests information about a Library/API. Bot provides the information about the library/API and the relevant links.
3 Sub Flow:
  [s1] User requests information about a Library/API.
  [s2] Bot lists the Machine Learning Libraries in python asking User to select a Library.
  [s3] User selects the Library.
  [s4] Bot provides information about the selected Library and relevant links to it and asks User whether he wants a specific information about a method/function.
  [s5] User responds by selecting his preference and enters the name of the method/function.
  [s6] Bot gives description and relevant links about the given method/function.
4 Alternate Flow:
  [E1] No known method/function is provided by the user. Bot gives a message that method/function is not found.
```

## Architecture Design 

### Architecture Diagram and component details:

**The architecture diagram:**
![](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-23/blob/master/resources/images/Architecture%20Diagram.png)

The architecture consists of three major components:-
1. Mattermost bot as a client for interacting with the user.
2. Server which processes the client request by calling appropriate Python APIs’.
3. A database required for storing commonly asked questions and their corresponding answers and a database required to store information regarding the description for Machine Learning APIs in Python

Within these 3 main components the function of the sub components are as follows: 

**1. Front end of the bot**

   *- Suggest an ML model for a given dataset:*
   
     - The user specifies that they wish to know what the best model is to apply on their dataset(numerical/image). The bot passes this request to the Extraction Component which then understands the intent of the user and passes the intent and the corresponding entities to the respective components, i.e. Message Generator for image data set, and Model Suggestion Component for numerical data set. The result is then passed back to the user through the Message Generator component.  
   
   *- Look for a description of a Library/API:*
   
      - The user requests for information about an ML library or API in python. This request is extracted by the extraction component and then sent to the message generator which fetches the relevant information from the ML Library/API Information database and delivers the result back to the user 
   
   *- Look for an answer:* 
      
      - The user posts a question to the bot which is extracted by the extraction component which then sends it to the message generator in turn. The message generator then looks into the Q/A Bank for the answer to the question and returns it to the user, if there exists some answer, and an appropriate message in the case that there is no answer to the user’s question. 
   *- Post an answer:*
      
      - The extraction component extracts the user’s intent to post an answer for a question and passes it to the message generator which then looks into the Q/A bank for the question and then allows the user to post an answer to the question and then write the answer to the Q/A database. 

**2. Backend of the bot**

   *- Extraction component:*
      
      - This extracts the users’ intent and the corresponding inputs (entities) from the user and passes it on to the other components accordingly 
   *- Message Generator:*
   
      - This component has a set of predefined questions which are asked to the user in order to extract the intent of the user. It also responds to the users’ requests with the content it receives from the respective components responsible for handling the users' request. 
   *- Model Suggestion:*
      
      - This component accepts the numerical data set, preprocesses it, applies a set of models from the scikitlearn package in Python and arrives at the best model for the dataset and passes on this as the result back to the user via the message generator.

**3. Databases**
   
   *- Q/A Bank:*
      
      - This consists of a set of commonly asked questions and answers related to ML libraries in Python 
   *- ML Library/API Information Bank:*
      
      - This consists of the various libraries available and their corresponding descriptions.

### Architecture constraints and guidelines:
The following are the constraints of the bot:-
1. For the first case, when the user wishes to understand what model to apply on a dataset, the bot can only suggest models for image or a numerical data set. 
2. The bot has limited number of functionality and focuses only on machine learning APIs and is equipped to handle only the use cases specified.
3. Since the bot follows a reactor design pattern, the user cannot follow up on any of the operations.  

### Additional design patterns:
The following are the design patterns that are to be implemented in the project.
1. ***Builder Pattern-*** This bot separates object construction from its representation and hence follows the builder pattern
2. ***Object-Pool Pattern -*** This bot is developed to avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use 
3. ***Bridge Pattern-*** It is required for the clients of this bot to not be exposed to the complexity of the implementation of the objects. Therefore, this bot follows the bridge pattern which separates an object’s interface from its implementation
4. ***Chain-of-responsibilty Pattern -*** There is no direct coupling between the sender of a request (the user) and the receiver (the destination of the user’s intent). The user’s request passes through a set of processing elements instead and hence this bot follows the chain-of-responsibilty pattern.
5. ***Mediator Design Pattern-*** This pattern eases the communication between different objects by defining an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. For this bot, there is a component that promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly
6. ***Factory Pattern -*** To create an instance of several derived classes, this pattern is followed. This facilitates easy management, instantiation and delegation of objects and other creation details supplied by the client.
7. ***Conversational-styled pattern -*** the interaction between the user and the bot will follow typical query-response pattern.
8. ***Command -*** To encapsulate the tasks to be performed as objects and passing them on for further execution through other components, this pattern is followed.
