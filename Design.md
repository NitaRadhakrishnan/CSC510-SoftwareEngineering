# Initial Draft 

## Objective 
To develop a bot system that assists visitors with their requests and queries pertaining to the library. 
## Problem Statement  
Consider a library "ABC" that hosts several books and scholarly articles which can be accessed physically and digitally. The library also has several visitors, but has only a handful of librarians to attend to the visitors. This results in a huge load on the librarians especially during peak and late hours, which may consequentially increase the wait time for the visitors as well. 

There are also some cases when the visitors are not definitive of what sources they are looking for. In such cases, it becomes difficult for a librarian to manually search and suggest what might be a potential source. Therefore, both, the librarians as well as the visitors are in need of a solution that will introduce efficiency into this system. 

## Bot Description

The situation presented in the previous section can be eased by introducing our bot system L.I.B.R.R.A. (Library-Intensive Bot for Resource and Recommendation Assistance) that interacts with the vistors and caters to their interests in the same way that a librarian does. In other words, it chats with the visitors to understand their requests. Having a bot system to chat with at any hour of the day without having to wait for the librarian is an optimal solution for the visitors. Adding the feature of being able to understand the visitor's query and suggesting a list of sources that the visitor might find useful is a bonus to using a bot system for library management.  

The bot is developed to check availability of books to visitors, accepting returned books, answering simple queries regarding facilities and services offered by the library, and suggesting a list of top 5 sources that closely match a query posed by a visitor on what kind of source they are looking for, by performing text mining on the query. This makes it a Documentation Bot as it is equipped to answer users' questions in a human-like manner. This bot follows the "reactor" design pattern which chats with the users when they ask their questions as well as responds to cases when the user chooses to issue or return a book, but has no memory of who the user is.
