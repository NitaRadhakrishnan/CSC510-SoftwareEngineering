- **Assigned:** Manikanta (@vnukala2)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Blockers:** None 
- **Comments**:
    - Developed the working service of the retrieval using keyword extraction and sending the database information to the bot.

#### Integration 
**Task 1:** Intelligently select which use case to execute depending upon user's message.(4)
- **Assigned:** Rajshree (rjain27)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Blockers:** None 
- **Comments:** 

**Task 2:** Determine all the use cases and check how the bot should handle the requests and responses in all the cases.(6)
- **Assigned:** Rajshree (rjan27)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Blockers:** None 
- **Comments:** 

**Practices**:  
  - We followed pair programming while developing the tasks. For example, Task 2 in Usecase 3 is implemented by @vnukala2 while @nradhak2 guides the steps.
  - We followed Continuous Integration and Continuous Developement while developing the tasks. For example, Everytime a task is completed we did an end to end testing for that task and resolved any integration issues occurred.
